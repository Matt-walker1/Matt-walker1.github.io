        <p> My name is Matthew Walker. I am a student at the University of Rhode Island. I am studying to get my Animal Sciences degree.
      Over summer I work for the Eastern Ice Company delivering bags of ice to store to store. I have always been a big follower of video games, especially Nintendo. I also like to enjoy every moment I get to be with my mom, dad, and brother.
